### Features
* Interactive Visualization: High-performance line charts allow for zooming, panning, and toggling specific signals like "Engine Rpm" or "Camshaft Overlap".

*  Dual Data Sources:

* *  Local: Drag-and-drop JSON file upload.

* * Cloud: "Drive Scan" integration allows loading logs directly from Google Drive.

* Anomaly Detection: Built-in scanner to automatically find dangerous engine conditions using customizable templates (e.g., "High Load / Spark Retard").

* Event Highlighting: Automatically highlights detected anomaly ranges (red vertical zones) on the chart timeline for quick analysis.

* Smart Signal Mapping: Uses a strict alias system to map messy CSV headers to standardized fields, preventing data mix-ups (e.g., distinguishing Intake Manifold form Camshaft Overlap).
