# MyGiulia LOG Viewer

A lightweight, browser-based telemetry log viewer designed for automotive diagnostics generated by the [MyGiulia](https://github.com/tzebrowski/ObdGraphs "MyGiulia") Android application. This tool allows users to visualize JSON logs, scan for performance anomalies, and sync files directly from Google Drive.

## 🚀 Modern Architecture (Vite & ESM)

This project has been migrated from a legacy global-script structure to a modern **Vite** architecture. This transition ensures a high-performance "Single Package" build and a clean developer experience.

* **Bundler**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for ultra-fast development and optimized production builds.
* **Architecture**: Fully modular **ES Modules** (ESM) structure, eliminating global variable pollution.
* **Charts**: [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) integrated via NPM, utilizing the `date-fns` adapter and `zoom` plugin.
* **Linting**: Automated code quality enforcement via **ESLint** (JS) and **Stylelint** (CSS).

## ✨ Features

* **Vite-Optimized**: Assets are bundled and minified, preventing MIME type errors and ensuring fast load times.
* **Interactive Visualization**: High-performance line charts with smooth zooming and panning (supported by Hammer.js).
* **Dual Data Sources**:
    * **Local**: Drag-and-drop JSON file upload for instant analysis.
    * **Cloud**: Integrated Google Drive sync via the modern Google Identity Services (GSI) and GAPI.
* **Anomaly Detection**: Built-in scanner using customizable JSON templates to identify dangerous engine conditions (e.g., "High Load / Spark Retard").
* **Event Highlighting**: Automatically identifies and highlights detected anomaly ranges on the chart timeline.
* **Smart Signal Mapping**: Uses a strict alias system to map raw telemetry headers to standardized fields.
